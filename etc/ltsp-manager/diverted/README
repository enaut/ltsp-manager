ltsp-manager diverts into this folder some files of other packages that
cause issues, so that the system doesn't find them and the issues are
bypassed.

The list of those files can be shown with
  dpkg-divert --list ltsp-manager

On ltsp-manager uninstallation (apt purge ltsp-manager) those files are
restored to their original location.
